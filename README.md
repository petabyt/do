# Things that I want to be made or can't find
- [ ] OSS clone of https://pingendo.com/ which generates sites with no JS
- [ ] Powerful Linux USB media/formatting tool (like Rufus) or adding usb flash media support to qemu
- [ ] Alternative `make` implementation with better performance and debug tools
- [ ] Shared library manager (not a package manager or source code manager) that manages archive/so/dll/dylib files of all ABIs and versions of various large frameworks and libraries to help with cross-compiling and dependency hell
